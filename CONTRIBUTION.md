We are using trello to ease the work, it is very easy and intuitive, just like goolo!
Trello Link:
https://trello.com/invite/b/URgvcHYw/81a7c9a217afc74173d3baf4a3b10029/clotheswipe

A couple of rules to make it easier to work together:
1. If you are working on something, move it to the "doing section" on trello.
2. Work only on branches which specify what you are working on, It is highly recommended no to work on master.
3. Once you push to the repository, please write a message here so we could pull it from the repo and enjoy your work.
4. We do have a QA contibuter but dont be afraid to write new issues :slightly_smiling_face:

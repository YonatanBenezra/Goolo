# Goolo 

Goolo is a swiper, which learns what you like and shows you exactly the clothes you like, all in one place and with
an interactive left/right swipe.
With a potential affiliation business model :)

## Why was Goolo made and why you should use it

1. I understood the world of not being able to 
   choose clothes is not my own concern.
2. Goolo helps me and I hope others to ease the pain
   of looking for the right clothes!
3. Are you a clothing shop?
   uncustomized buying experience 
   makes customers to bounce between websites in a chase after clothes they like, which leads to less sales.
   Feel free to use this open source code!
